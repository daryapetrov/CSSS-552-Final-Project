Instant runoff voting (IRV), is used in various public elections around the United States. This voting system allows voters to give a ranked preference of multiple candidates, as opposed to ranking only one candidate such as in the first-past-the-post voting system. In IRV elections, voters are not required to rank all of the candidates, so natural missingness arises when some voters forgo providing a rank for all of the candidates. Additionally, strategic missing tactics are sometimes utilized by voters, rather than simply providing a ranking based on their true candidate preferences, to influence the outcome of an election. The effect of such missingness on the outcome of the election is explored here through a simulation study, with a couple of the simulations motivated by real IRV elections in Alaska and Minneapolis, Minnesota. The results of the simulations show that generally the more voters that participate in an election, the less effect missingness has on the election outcome.
